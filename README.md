## Frozen v3.4.2 campaign

This Go baseline retains the exact v3.4.2 Global Passport campaign:

- sealed vectors: **26/26 PASS**;
- sealed-kit SHA-256: `ced70113f1d153627eb972b11adbf20e502ed086e0b13e8abf1dc5adc4c2e716`;
- canonical campaign result SHA-256: `45af773554a7191c1b49a75c636a1106afb1de36d788bb00d7af56097b8d1b0e`;
- required `overall_valid: true`.

The version label identifies the frozen evidence target and does not state that v3.4.2 is the current runtime.

Run it:

```bash
go run ./cmd/passport-v34
```

## Other controlled campaigns

```bash
go run ./cmd/entity-verify test
go run ./cmd/adoption-v32
go run ./cmd/reality-v33
```

See [`.github/workflows/cleanroom-verify.yml`](.github/workflows/cleanroom-verify.yml) for CI and evidence capture.

## Where this fits now

ENTITY v3.4.3 is the current supported runtime. BTDU remains component 3.4.2 unchanged. Protocol 1.0 is a separate frozen external clean-room target; BTDU, ADAM and NIKI are not additional Protocol 1.0 requirements unless the sealed Protocol 1.0 material explicitly says so.

## Verification boundary

A PASS here shows that this **BTG-controlled Go baseline** matches the frozen v3.4.2 target. It does not by itself establish independent implementation, full external interoperability/recovery, objective external truth, legal title, regulatory compliance, accounting fair value, upstream ownership or automatic economic entitlement.

## Contributing

Reproducible failures, portability fixes, language-idiomatic improvements, test corrections, specification ambiguities and counterexamples are useful. Independent conformance evidence should live in a repository controlled outside BTG.
